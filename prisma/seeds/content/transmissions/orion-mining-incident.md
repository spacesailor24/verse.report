## Emergency Response

The RSI Orion mining platform 'Prometheus Forge' experienced a catastrophic failure in its primary refinery module while processing high-grade quantainium ore in the Aaron Halo.

### Incident Details
- **Time**: 23:32 Standard Time
- **Cause**: Quantainium instability cascade in Refinery Bay 3
- **Casualties**: 12 injured, 0 fatalities
- **Evacuation**: All 200 crew members successfully evacuated

### Damage Assessment
- Primary refinery module: Total loss
- Secondary systems: Moderate damage
- Hull integrity: Compromised but stable
- Ore stores: 15,000 SCU lost to space

### Investigation
Initial findings suggest improper storage temperature caused quantainium crystals to destabilize. Safety protocols prevented chain reaction that could have destroyed the entire platform.

### Industry Impact
This incident highlights the need for enhanced quantainium handling procedures across all mining operations.

**Platform Status**: Disabled pending full investigation and repairs
