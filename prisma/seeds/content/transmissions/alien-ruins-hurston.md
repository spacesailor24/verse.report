## Significant Discovery

Mining operations on Hurston have been temporarily halted after the discovery of what appears to be pre-terraforming architectural structures.

### Initial Analysis
- **Age**: Estimated 800-1200 years old
- **Construction**: Unknown crystalline composite material
- **Style**: Geometric patterns consistent with Xi'an design philosophy
- **Size**: Complex spans approximately 2.5 square kilometers

### Artifacts Recovered
- 12 intact crystalline tablets with unknown script
- Metallic devices with quantum resonance properties
- Biological samples showing advanced genetic modification

### Research Implications
This discovery could rewrite our understanding of early Xi'an exploration patterns and suggest they had presence in human space centuries before first contact.

**Access Restricted**: Site cordoned off pending full archaeological survey.
