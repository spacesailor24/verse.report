## Unprecedented Encounter

A geological survey team on microTech has reported an encounter with a massive sand worm-like creature emerging from beneath the planet's ice fields.

### Creature Characteristics
- **Length**: Estimated 300+ meters
- **Diameter**: Approximately 15 meters
- **Behavior**: Non-aggressive, curious about survey equipment
- **Environment**: Adapted to extreme cold conditions

### Encounter Details
The creature emerged near Survey Station Delta while the team was conducting deep ice core sampling. Initial panic gave way to scientific fascination as the creature showed no hostile intent.

### Biological Observations
- Segmented carapace with crystalline formations
- Bioluminescent patterns along body length
- Specialized appendages for ice/rock navigation
- Unknown energy emission signatures

### Safety Protocols
All surface operations in the northern ice fields are suspended pending xenobiology team assessment. The creature has returned beneath the ice but monitoring equipment detects continued movement.

**Research Classification**: Priority Level 2 Xenofauna Study
