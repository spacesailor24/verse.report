## Unprecedented Intercept

Independent information runner Sarah Kim, piloting the Drake Herald 'Data Stream', has intercepted an unknown alien communication transmission while conducting routine data courier operations near the Pyro system.

### Discovery Details
- **Location**: Deep space between Pyro and Nyx systems
- **Duration**: 47-second burst transmission
- **Frequency**: Previously unused quantum communication band
- **Encryption**: Highly sophisticated, possibly quantum-encrypted

### Communication Analysis
- Origin point triangulated to empty space beyond known jump points
- Signal strength suggests transmission from extremely distant source
- Mathematical structures unlike any known alien species patterns
- Possible automated beacon or navigation signal

### Technical Specifications
The Herald's advanced data interception systems captured the full transmission before it faded, providing scientists with complete data for analysis.

### Expert Opinion
"This represents either a previously unknown alien species or a significant advancement in communication technology beyond our current understanding." - Dr. Chen, UEE Xenocommunications Institute

### Security Implications
The transmission's discovery location raises questions about uncharted jump points and possible alien presence in supposedly empty space.

**Status**: Data under analysis at classified research facility
