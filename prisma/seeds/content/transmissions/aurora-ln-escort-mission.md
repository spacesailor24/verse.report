## David vs Goliath

A squadron of six RSI Aurora LN fighters successfully escorted a medical supply convoy through pirate-controlled space, demonstrating that determination trumps expensive hardware.

### Mission Parameters
- **Convoy Size**: 4 medical transport vessels
- **Cargo**: Emergency medical supplies for plague outbreak
- **Escort**: 6 Aurora LN fighters (volunteer pilots)
- **Route**: Through Nine Tails controlled territory

### Engagement Summary
Pirates in superior ships (2 Cutlass Black, 4 Gladius) attempted to intercept the convoy but were repelled by coordinated Aurora squadron tactics.

### Tactical Success
- Formation flying maximized defensive capabilities
- Coordinated missile salvos overwhelmed pirate shields
- One Aurora damaged but no losses to convoy or escorts
- Pirates withdrew after losing one Gladius

### Humanitarian Impact
The medical supplies reached the outbreak zone 18 hours ahead of schedule, potentially saving hundreds of lives on the frontier colony.

### Pilot Recognition
All six Aurora pilots receive Humanitarian Service medals and 50,000 credit bonuses from grateful colonists.

### Lesson Learned
"It's not about having the biggest guns - it's about having the biggest heart and the smartest tactics." - Squadron Leader Martinez

**Mission Status**: Complete Success
