## Heroic Rescue

Independent pilot Marcus Chen flying the RSI Constellation Andromeda 'Star Wanderer' has successfully rescued a research team stranded in deep space after their vessel suffered catastrophic system failure.

### Mission Details
- **Rescue Vessel**: RSI Constellation Andromeda 'Star Wanderer'
- **Distressed Vessel**: Scientific ship 'Discovery'
- **Location**: 40 AU from nearest inhabited system
- **Rescued Personnel**: 12 xenobiology researchers

### Emergency Situation
The research vessel 'Discovery' suffered complete power failure while studying exotic plasma formations in deep space. With life support failing and no quantum drive capability, the crew faced a dire situation.

### Rescue Operation
Chen's Constellation was the only vessel within rescue range. Using the ship's extended-range capabilities and cargo bay, he successfully evacuated all 12 crew members before the research vessel's life support failed completely.

### Recognition
The UEE Search and Rescue Service awards Chen the Medal of Stellar Service for exceptional courage and skill.

**Transit Time**: 18 hours to reach nearest medical facility
