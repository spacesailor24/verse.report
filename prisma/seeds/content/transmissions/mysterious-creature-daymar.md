## Incident Report

Miners at Kudre Ore facility on Daymar have reported sightings of an enormous creature moving beneath the moon's sandy surface.

"It was like watching a mountain move under the sand. The whole ground shook, and we saw these... ridges, maybe 200 meters long, pushing up through the dunes." - Foreman Jenkins

### Characteristics
- Estimated length: 150-200 meters
- Subterranean movement patterns
- Appears to follow mining vehicle vibrations
- Bioluminescent traces left in sand after passage

### Safety Advisory
All mining operations in Sector 7 have been suspended pending xenobiology team investigation. Workers are advised to maintain vehicles at idle when stationary to avoid attracting the creature.
