## Magnificent Migration

A pod of 23 space whales has been observed traveling through the Leir system, following ancient migration patterns that span multiple star systems.

### Observation Data
- **Pod Size**: 23 individuals
- **Largest Specimen**: 890 meters in length
- **Travel Speed**: 0.15c (sustained)
- **Formation**: Perfect V-formation maintained for 72+ hours

### Behavioral Notes
- Complex harmonic vocalizations detected across multiple frequencies
- Gravitational wake patterns suggest coordinated quantum field manipulation
- No aggressive behavior toward observing vessels

### Research Implications
The whales appear to navigate using quantum entanglement with distant stellar objects, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of biological navigation systems.

### Conservation Status
All vessels are required to maintain 50km minimum distance. Harassment of space whales carries severe UEE penalties.

**Tracking Duration**: Pod expected to exit Leir system within 48 hours
